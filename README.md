# Neo Vault

This is a WIP app so that the user can set up a master passcode to gain access to
their saved passwords.

To run:

* Clone the project.
* Make sure you have `npm` installed (run `npm --version`; tested with `npm 8.4.0`).
* From the root project directory, install the node modules by running `npm install`.
* Make sure you have `expo` installed (run `expo --version`; tested with `expo 5.0.3`).
* Make sure you have set up an Android emulator (so far this is only tested on Android) and it is running.
* Run expo for Android: `expo run android`.
